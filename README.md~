#Apollo11

###hello, houston.

Apollo11 is a framework project for elementary OS, hopefully good enough I can start eating the dogfood soon.

The ultimate goal is to develop a skeleton to save developers starting from tabula rasa for every new project and allow them to expect to be able to publish from T minus zero.

###features.
* CMake builds with only elementary-sdk.
* Headerbar already set up.
